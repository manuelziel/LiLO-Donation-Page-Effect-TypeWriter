# LiLO Donation Page Effect

This repository contains the implementation of a special thank-you effect for the LiLO party's donation page. The effect is activated once a user successfully completes a donation.

## Overview

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display an animated fireworks effect and a typewriter animation thanking donors. It utilizes the `typewriter-effect` library to dynamically display messages.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Main file containing the container for the effect and the canvas element.
- `style.css`: Contains all style definitions for the effect.
- `script.js`: JavaScript code for the typewriter animation and fireworks particles.

Integrate the files into your existing web project or open the `index.html` directly in a browser to test the effect locally.

## Usage

Add the HTML structure to your donation page HTML file. Ensure the paths to the CSS and JS files are correct so that the styles and scripts can be loaded properly.

## Customization

You can customize the messages in the typewriter animation as needed by changing the text in the `.typeString()` methods in `script.js`.
